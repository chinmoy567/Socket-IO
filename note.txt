Socket.IO – Simple Meanings

io
Means: the Socket.IO server
Think: the whole system / all users

socket
Means: one connection (one user)
Think: a single person connected

on
Means: listen / wait for something to happen
Think: “when this happens, do this”

emit
Means: send / fire / trigger
Think: “send this event now”

---

Put together:

io.on("connection", ...)
Means:
“When the server gets a new connection, run this code”

socket.emit("message", data)
Means:
“Send a message from this socket”

socket.on("message", ...)
Means:
“When this socket receives a message, run this code”

---

One-line memory trick:

io = everyone
socket = one person
on = listen
emit = send







Server-side Events (Socket.IO)

connection
Fired when a client connects to the server.

disconnect
Fired when a client disconnects from the server.

message
Custom event (user-defined for sending/receiving data).

join
Not a built-in event; used as a custom event to add a socket to a room.

leave
Not a built-in event; used as a custom event to remove a socket from a room.

ping / pong
Internal heartbeat mechanism (not used directly in application logic).

Client-side Events (Socket.IO)

connect
Fired when the client successfully connects to the server.

disconnect
Fired when the client disconnects.

reconnect
Fired when the client reconnects after a disconnect.

connect_error
Fired when a connection attempt fails.

reconnect_attempt
Fired before each reconnection attempt.

reconnect_failed
Fired when reconnection fails completely.

message
Custom event for receiving messages from the server.

Important Note

Only connection / disconnect (server) and connect / disconnect (client) are built-in core events.

Message, join, leave are custom events, defined by the developer.

Ping/Pong are handled internally by Socket.IO.







Custom event created on server side and caught on client side.
